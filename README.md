### Advanced Settings

```yaml
advanced:
  # Debug mode (prints additional information to console)
  debug: false
  # Maximum number of simultaneous appearances
  max_appearances: 1
  # Time in seconds before Herobrine disappears
  appearance_duration: 10
  # Minimum distance from player for appearances (in blocks)
  min_appearance_distance: 15
  # Maximum distance from player for appearances (in blocks)
  max_appearance_distance: 25
  # Number of attempts to find a valid spawn location (10-100)
  # Increase this if Herobrine fails to spawn in complex terrain
  spawn_attempts: 30
```

> **Important Server Configuration**: For Herobrine to work correctly, your server's
> `entity-activation-range.misc` in `spigot.yml` must be **greater than or equal to**
> `max_appearance_distance`. If it's lower, Herobrine's NPC will be inactive beyond that
> range and fail to spawn. Similarly, `entity-broadcast-range-percentage` in
> `server.properties` should be set to `100` to ensure the NPC is visible at the
> configured appearance distances.

### Paranoia System Settings

```yaml
paranoia:
  # Enable/disable the paranoia system
  enabled: true
  # Base exposure level for new players (0.0 - 1.0)
  initial_exposure: 0.1
  # How quickly exposure increases with each encounter (0.0 - 1.0)
  exposure_growth_rate: 0.05
  # Maximum distance for subtle appearances (further than normal appearances)
  far_appearance_distance: 50
  # Enable distant silhouette appearances
  distant_silhouettes: true
  # Enable peripheral vision appearances (only visible when not looking directly)
  peripheral_appearances: true
  # Chance for Herobrine to disappear when looked at directly (0.0 - 1.0)
  vanish_when_seen_chance: 0.8
  # Enable/disable exposure-based effects intensity
  adaptive_effects: true
```

## Summoning Shrine

You can summon Herobrine directly by building a special shrine:

1. Place a **Mossy Cobblestone** block as the center
2. Place four **Gold Blocks** in a cross pattern around the mossy cobblestone (north, south, east, west)
3. Place **Redstone Torches** on top of each gold block
4. Place a **Netherrack** block on top of the mossy cobblestone
5. Light the netherrack on **Fire**

When built correctly, lightning will strike, Herobrine will appear, and the shrine will be consumed.

## Features In Depth

### Player Memory System

The plugin remembers each player's encounters with Herobrine and adapts behavior accordingly:
- Players who ignore Herobrine may see him more frequently
- Players who actively engage with structures will see more personalized structures
- Players who attack Herobrine might face increased aggression

### Structure Creation

Herobrine will occasionally create mysterious structures in the world:
- **Sand Pyramids**: Small pyramids in oceans or deserts
- **Redstone Caves**: Tunnels with redstone torches leading underground
- **Stripped Trees**: Trees with leaves removed in a forest
- **Mysterious Tunnels**: 2×2 tunnels leading deep underground
- **Glowstone E**: Glowstone arranged in an E pattern underground
- **Wooden Crosses**: Wooden cross structures
- **Tripwire Traps**: Hidden traps with TNT underneath
- **Creepy Signs**: Signs with disturbing messages

### Psychological Effects

The plugin includes several psychological effects designed to create an unsettling atmosphere:

- **Flashing Text**: Momentary flashes of disturbing messages at the corner of the player's screen, creating a subliminal effect
- **Fake Error Messages**: Realistic-looking Minecraft error messages that appear during intense encounters
- **Screen Shake**: Disorienting camera movements during encounters that increase with intensity
- **Action Bar Messages**: Cryptic messages that appear in the action bar during encounters
- **Glitchy Messages**: Text with intentional corruption and glitchy characters

### Maze Teleportation

A rare but intense encounter where players are temporarily transported to a maze-like structure:

- **Disorientation**: Players are suddenly teleported to an unfamiliar location for 15-30 seconds
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Soul particles, eerie sounds, and vision impairment add to the horror
- **Guaranteed Return**: Players are always returned to their original location after the event
- **Intensity-Based Experience**: Higher intensity encounters result in longer stays and more effects
- **Rare Occurrence**: Only happens during specific encounters or with a very small random chance

### Skinwalker Effect

One of the most psychologically disturbing features that affects passive animals around the player:

- **Three Behavior Modes**:
  - **Stare Only**: Animals freeze and stare at the player without attacking
  - **Delayed Attack**: Animals stare first, then collectively attack the player
  - **Provoked Attack**: Animals only attack if the player attacks them first
- **Realistic Animal Behavior**: Animals turn their heads to follow the player with their gaze
- **Visual Indicators**: Soul particles and effects show which animals are "possessed"
- **Audio Cues**: Unsettling sounds accompany the effect
- **Integration**: Works with the paranoia system for escalating encounters

### Paranoia System

The Paranoia System creates a slow-building horror experience that gradually intensifies based on player exposure to Herobrine:

- **Exposure Levels**: Each player has an invisible "exposure" rating that increases with each Herobrine encounter
- **Subtle Initial Encounters**: New players will only see Herobrine at extreme distances or in their peripheral vision
- **Vanishing Act**: At low exposure levels, Herobrine may disappear when looked at directly
- **Progressive Intensity**: As exposure increases:
  - Herobrine will appear closer and for longer durations
  - Environmental effects become more pronounced
  - Encounters shift from subtle glimpses to active stalking
  - Sound effects become more frequent and disturbing
- **Psychological Horror**: The system is designed to make players question what they saw:
  - Was that really Herobrine in the distance?
  - Did something just move at the edge of my vision?
  - Are those footsteps following me?
- **Gradual Escalation**: Unlike immediate jump scares, the Paranoia System creates a mounting sense of dread over multiple play sessions

This feature transforms Herobrine from a simple monster into a psychological horror element that adapts to each player's experience level, making the plugin effective for both new players and those who have encountered Herobrine many times before.
